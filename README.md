# 📈 Business Case: Telecom Checkout Optimization & Churn Reduction

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In a highly competitive telecom industry, customer churn and low loyalty engagement were negatively impacting recurring revenue and long-term customer value.

### Key Challenges:
- High checkout page abandonment rate
- Limited pre-sales engagement before purchase completion
- Low loyalty program interaction
- Rising churn among prepaid and mid-tier subscribers
- Lack of real-time intent capture during checkout

---

## 🚀 Strategic Hypothesis

Optimizing the checkout experience and introducing a Pre-Sales Ticket Feature would:

1. Reduce checkout abandonment
2. Capture high-intent users before drop-off
3. Increase loyalty engagement
4. Improve assisted conversions
5. Reduce churn through proactive engagement

# 🛠 Initiative 1: Checkout Page Optimization

## Key Enhancements

- Reduced checkout flow from multi-step to single dynamic page
- Integrated real-time validation APIs
- Personalized plan recommendations
- Loyalty score-based offers
- Performance optimization (improved page load time)
- Smart cross-sell add-ons engine

---

## 💻 Sample Business Logic (Illustrative)

```javascript
function recommendPlan(userUsage, loyaltyScore) {
    if (loyaltyScore > 80) {
        return "Premium 5G Plan with Loyalty Bonus";
    } else if (userUsage > 20) {
        return "Unlimited Data Plan";
    } else {
        return "Smart Saver Plan";
    }
}
```

# 🧩 Initiative 2: Pre-Sales Ticket Feature

## Feature Capabilities

- Embedded "Need Help?" CTA on checkout page

- Loyalty-triggered retention offers

---

## 💻 Pre-Sales Ticket Logic (Illustrative)

```javascript
function handlePresales(userClicksHelp, cartValue, userID) {
    const threshold = 1000;

    if (userClicksHelp && cartValue > threshold) {
        createPresalesTicket(userID);
        assignPriority("High Intent");
        triggerLoyaltyOffer(userID);
    }
}
```
